# About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.png" alt="Photo of Alayna in a blue shirt standing in front of some trees">}}


As an **evolutionary plant biologist focused on climate adaptation**, I seek to understand plant 
responses to the environment across time scales – plastic responses across days, seasons, or 
years; and evolutionary responses across generations, populations, and species.

I am currently an NSF Plant Genome Postdoctoral Fellow, working with [Jill Hamilton](https://jillahamilton.com/index.html) at Penn State University.
I completed my PhD in 2023 with [Victoria Sork](https://sorklab.eeb.ucla.edu/) at UCLA.

# Research Interests

My work focuses on understanding the mechanisms of evolution both for the insight it provides into natural 
history and as a tool for conserving plants under rapidly changing climates. Forest trees are often 
foundational species in ecosystems, and their life history characteristics –- long lifespans, high 
gene flow, and high genetic diversity –- make them interesting subjects for studying evolution. 
My research includes both model species (*Populus*, poplars or cottonwoods) and non-model species 
(*Quercus*, oaks), as well as both common and endangered species. My work is rooted in genomic methods,
but I believe that genomics is most useful when genetic variation can be linked to its phenotypic 
significance, so I also incorporate measurements of functional and ecophysiological traits.
