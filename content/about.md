# About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.png" alt="avatar">}}


As an evolutionary plant biologist focused on climate adaptation, I seek to understand plant 
responses to the environment across time scales â€“ plastic responses across days, seasons, or 
years; and evolutionary responses across generations, populations, and species.

I am currently an NSF Plant Genome Postdoctoral Fellow, working with Jill Hamilton at Penn State University.
I completed my PhD in 2023 with Victoria Sork at UCLA.

# Research Interests

My work focuses on understanding the mechanisms of evolution both for the insight it provides into natural history 
and as a tool for conserving plants under rapidly changing climates. Forest trees are often foundational species 
in ecosystems, and their life history characteristics - long lifespans, high gene flow, and high genetic diversity -
make them interesting subjects for studying evolution. My research includes both model species (*Populus*, poplars or
cottonwoods) and non-model species (*Quercus*, oaks), as well as both common and endangered species. My work is rooted
in genomic methods, but I believe that genomics is most useful when genetic variation can be linked to its phenotypic 
significance, so I also incorporate measurements of functional and ecophysiological traits.
